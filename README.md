# Cyclistic Case Study: Google Data Analytics Capstone 
(https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)

## Introduction
I will conduct data analysis to finalize my project in the Google Data Analytics Capstone. For this purpose, I will utilize SQL BigQuery and Tableau as my primary analytical tools.

## Background
### Scenario
As a junior data analyst within the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company located in Chicago, the director of marketing has expressed the perspective that the organization's future prosperity hinges on optimizing the count of annual memberships.
### About The Company
Cyclistic, the bike-share company in Chicago, started in 2016 and now has 5,824 bikes at 692 stations. You can pick up and return bikes at any station. Until now, they tried to get a lot of people interested by offering different passes – single rides, full days, and yearly memberships. But now, they see that yearly members bring in more money. The marketing director, Moreno, wants to focus on getting more people to become yearly members instead of trying to find entirely new customers. She thinks it's a good idea because many people already know about Cyclistic and use it for getting around.

## Approach
### 1. Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### 2. Prepare
